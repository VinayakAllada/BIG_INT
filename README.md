# Big Integer Arithmetic

This project implements Big Integer Arithmetic in C, supporting addition, subtraction, and multiplication of arbitrarily large integers.

# Features

Addition (ADD) of large integers

Subtraction (SUB) with proper sign handling

Multiplication (MULTI) of large numbers

Comparison (compare) function for handling sign and magnitude

# File Structure

BIG_INT.c - The main source code implementing big integer operations.

# Usage

Compile the program using:

gcc BIG_INT.c -o big_int

# Run the program:

./big_int

Enter two large numbers when prompted, and the program will compute and display their sum, difference, and product.
